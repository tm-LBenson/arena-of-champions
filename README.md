# PvP Arena Game Design Document

## 1. Introduction
- **Purpose**: Create a PvP arena game that encapsulates the essence of strategic, cooldown-based combat without the need for prior character leveling or gear acquisition.
- **Inspiration**: Derived from the intense and strategic "go" moments in World of Warcraft (WoW) PvP, where players execute powerful offensive plays and counter with defensive cooldowns.

## 2. Game Objectives
- Deliver a balanced, strategic PvP experience where players engage in tactical battles, managing cooldowns to create opportunities for offense or defense.
- Provide a variety of classes with unique abilities, promoting diverse strategies and team compositions.

## 3. Gameplay Mechanics

### 3.1 Character Classes
- Outline of classes with a focus on their role in creating "go" moments:
  1. **Melee Fighter (Physical Damage)**: Excel at close-range combat, capable of significant burst damage.
  2. **Melee Fighter (Magic Damage)**: Specializes in magical assaults, using spells to weaken or overpower opponents.
  3. **Ranged Fighter (Physical Damage)**: Expert at dealing damage from afar, using precision attacks.
  4. **Ranged Fighter (Magic Damage)**: Uses elemental or arcane spells to attack targets from a distance.
  5. **Healer (Ranged)**: Focuses on healing allies from a safe distance, with abilities to mitigate incoming damage.
  6. **Healer (Close Range)**: Provides potent healing in the thick of battle, with abilities to escape or withstand enemy focus.

### 3.2 Abilities and Cooldowns
- **"Go" Moments**: Every minute, players can execute a "go" with high damage potential, forcing the opponent to respond with defensive cooldowns.
  - **Regular Go**: Occurs every minute, designed to test the enemy's defensive cooldown management.
  - **Big Go**: A more potent attack every 3 minutes, aiming to overwhelm the opponent by forcing multiple defensive cooldowns.
- **Cooldown Management**: Players must strategically manage their abilities' cooldowns to maximize offensive potential and minimize vulnerability.

### 3.3 Crowd Control (CC) and Defense
- **CC Mechanics**: Detail various CC abilities (stuns, roots, etc.) and their role in disrupting enemy plays or protecting allies during critical moments.
- **Diminishing Returns**: Implement diminishing returns on CC effects to prevent indefinite control of an opponent, encouraging tactical use of CC abilities.

## 4. Arenas
- Small, strategically designed arenas that encourage engagement and facilitate the execution of "go" moments.

## 5. Matchmaking System
- A fair and competitive matchmaking system that pairs players of similar skill levels, emphasizing balanced and engaging matches.

## 6. Progression and Rewards
- Focus on cosmetic rewards that allow character customization without affecting gameplay balance.

## 7. Technical Considerations
- **Game Engine**: Discuss the merits of Unity and Unreal Engine for developing the game, considering factors like ease of use, community support, and graphical capabilities.
- **Networking**: Address the importance of reliable networking to ensure smooth, lag-free gameplay.

## 8. Development Roadmap
- Phase-based development approach, from initial concept to prototype, followed by iterative testing and refinement.

## 9. Conclusion
- Reiterate the goal of creating a strategic, accessible PvP arena game inspired by the best aspects of WoW PvP, emphasizing strategic cooldown management and tactical play.
